The following observation datasets are available.

<UL>
<LI><B>ENSO Indices</B>: monthly NINO1+2, NINO3, NINO3.4 and NINO4 area-averaged sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) from 1856 to 
date using the <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.Indices/.nino/.EXTENDED/">Kaplan extended SST data</a>. The 
data are typically updated towards the end of the first week of each month. The areas are:
<UL>
<LI><B>NINO1+2</B>: 0-10S, 90W-80W
<LI><B>NINO3</B>: 5N-5S, 150W-90W
<LI><B>NINO3.4</B>: 5N-5S, 170W-120W
<LI><B>NINO4</B>: 5N-5S, 160E-150W
</UL>
<LI><B>SST</B>: monthly 2- by 2-degree SSTs from 1854 (for most analyses it is not recommended to use data prior to about 1950) 
to date from the <a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NCDC/.ERSST/.version4/">Extended Reconstructed 
Sea-Surface Temperature</a> dataset; version 5 of the dataset is accessed in CPT16 and later versions. Versions 3b and 4 were 
accessed in earlier versions of CPT. If you want to download version 3b or 4 instead of version 5, then the URL that CPT 
generates can be changed simply to "version3b" or "version4"in the appropriate section. The data are typically updated towards 
the end of the first week of each month.  This dataset does not require a password.
<LI><B>Maximum Temperature</B>: monthly 0.5- by 0.5-degree maximum air temperatures over land from 1901 to 2016 from the 
<a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.UEA/.CRU/.TS4p01/">University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit</a> gridded 
station dataset. Version 4.01 of the dataset is accessed in CPT16 and later versions; version 3.21 or 3.22 was accessed in 
earlier versions of CPT. This dataset is password protected. See information on 
<a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.UEA/.CRU/.TS4p01/.getting_permission.html">getting permission</a> for further 
details.
<LI><B>Minimum Temperature</B>: monthly 0.5- by 0.5-degree minimum air temperatures over land from 1901 to 2016 from the 
<a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.UEA/.CRU/.TS4p01/">University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit</a> gridded 
station dataset. Version 4.01 of the dataset is accessed in CPT16 and later versions; version 3.21 or 3.22 was accessed in 
earlier versions of CPT. This dataset is password protected. See information on

<LI><B>Mean Temperature</B>: monthly 0.5- by 0.5-degree mean air temperatures over land from 1901 to 2016 from the 
<a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.UEA/.CRU/.TS4p01/">University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit</a> gridded 
station dataset. Version 4.01 of the dataset is accessed in CPT16 and later versions; version 3.21 or 3.22 was accessed in 
earlier versions of CPT. This dataset is password protected. See information on

<LI><B>Precipitation</B>: monthly 0.5- by 0.5-degree wet-days over land from 1901. Two datasets are available: 
<UL>
<LI><a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.UEA/.CRU/.TS4p01/">University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit</a> 
contains data to December 2016. Version 4.01 of the dataset is accessed in CPT16 and later versions; version 3.21 or 3.22 was 
accessed in earlier versions of CPT. This dataset is password protected. See information on 
<a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.UEA/.CRU/.TS4p01/.getting_permission.html">getting permission</a> for further 
details.
<LI><a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.WCRP/.GCOS/.GPCC/.FDP/.version2018/">Global Precipitation Climatology Centre</a> 
contains data to December 2013. Version 2018 of the dataset is accessed in version 16.5 and later; version 6 or 7 was accessed 
in earlier versions of CPT. This dataset does not require a password.
</UL>
<LI><B>Wet-days</B>: monthly 0.5- by 0.5-degree wet-days over land from 1901 to 2013 from the 
<a href="http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.UEA/.CRU/.TS4p01/">University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit</a> gridded 
station dataset. Version 4.01 of the dataset is accessed in CPT16 and later versions; version 3.21 or 3.22 was accessed in
