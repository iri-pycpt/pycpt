<H2>451: Forecast Series</H2>
Tables of the forecasts for individual gridpoints/stations/series and a graph of the historical and current forecast(s) are
shown. The table shows the years for which the forecasts apply, some information about the definitions of the categories, and
the forecasts themselves, presented in different formats.<P>

In the thresholds box (top left) the climatological period is first indicated, and defines the data used to define the
categories. The thresholds dividing the categories are then given in the units of the original data, possibly standardized
depending on the <A HREF="Options_Tailor.html">standardization</A> option. For example, if the original data are in mm, and the 
anomaly standardization is selected, the thresholds will be in mm anomalies from the climatological average. The climatological 
probabilities, below, show the proportion of years in the climatological period that were in each category. By default these
probabilities will be 33% (assuming there are no ties, in which case the probabilities may deviate from 33% somewhat), but the 
actual probabilities will depend upon the <A HREF="Options_Tailor.html">threshold</A> settings. The climatological odds are equal
to the probability that the category in question was observed, divided by the probability that it was not observed. For example,
if the climatological probability of "above-normal" is 33% the odds will be 0.5 ("above-normal" occurs half as often as "normal"
and "below-normal" combined, i.e., it occurs half as of often as it does not occur).<P>

The forecasts box presents the forecast in different formats. Probabilistic forecasts and odds are presented first. If the 
climatological probabilities are equiprobable and the forecast probability for the "normal" category is the lower than for the 
outer categories, it may be worth <A HREF="Options_Data_Transform.html">transforming</A> the Y data so that they are normally
disrtibuted. Applying the transformation will require CPT to <A HREF="Actions_Reset.html">reset</A>. The probabilities are 
derived from the best-guess forecast (listed as "Forecast" under "Forecast ranges") by assuming that the errors in the 
best-guess forecast will be normally distributed (or, more strictly, follow a Student's <i>t</i> distribution), with the 
variance of the errors defined by the variance of the errors in the cross-validated predictions (alternative error variances 
can be set using <A HREF="Options_Forecast.html">Options ~ Forecast Settings</A>). If the Y data have been 
<A HREF="Options_Data_Transform.html">transformed</A> it is assumed that the forecast errors of the transformed data will be 
normally distributed. From the best-guess forecast and the assumed error variance and distribution the probabilities of 
exceeding the various thresholds can be calculated. Prediction intervals can also be calculated for a given level of 
confidence. The prediction intervals are shown as the upper and lower limits under "Forecast ranges". The default is to define
the intervals as one standard error from the best guess, which translates to a confidence level of about 68%. The default can 
be adjusted using <A HREF="Options_Forecast.html">Options ~ Forecast Settings</A>.<P>

The graph shows the history of the cross-validated forecasts (green line) and observations (red line), and the current 
forecast(s) shown by green crosses. The prediction intervals for the forecasts can be added by right-clicking on the graph,
and following the "Customize" option. The vertical coloured divisions show the three categories. Note that when calculating the 
cross-validated forecasts, the threshold defintions will have fluctuated slightly, and so the current categorization fo the
forecasts and observations may not exactly match the cross-validated classification. This fluctuation is the reason for any
apparent discrepancies between the graph and the <A HREF="Tools_Validate_Tables.html">contingency tables</A>.<P>

The forecasts can be saved by selecting the <B>Forecasts</B> tab from the <A HREF="File_Output_Results.html">File _Output 
Results</A>) menu. The graph itself can be saved as a BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PCX, or PNG file by right-clicking anywhere in the 
child window and selectgin <B>Export</B>. A default name is given to the graphic file, but this name can be changed using the 
browse button. The quality of the JPEG file can be adjusted using the slider or by the quality indicator, which ranges between 
0.01 and 1.00. The highest quality is obtained using 1.00. The size of the JPEG file is affected by the quality chosen, with 
larger files being generated the higher the selected quality. The image quality for all the graphics formats can be improved by 
increasing the size of the image (see <A HREF="Options_Graphics_GrphScaling.html">Options ~ Graphics ~ Graph Scaling</A>). The 
graphic title can be set using the <B>Customise</B> option upon right-clicking in the child window.<P>

The y-axis limits can be set by right-clicking on the image and then selecting the <B>Customise ~ Y-Axis Limits</B> option. The 
maximum and minimum values on the y-axis are indicated and can be reset. Resetting these axis limits will in turn automatically 
reset the tick-mark interval and number of tick marks. Greater flexibility for setting the tick marks is planned for future 
releases. Further options for customizing the graph, including adjusting the size of the fonts, and the size of the images, are 
available from <A HREF="Options_Graphics.html">Options ~ Graphics</A>.<P>
