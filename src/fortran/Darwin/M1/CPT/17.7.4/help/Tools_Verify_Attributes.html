<H2>431: Attributes Diagrams</H2>
The attributes diagrams are constructed using a set of probabilistic forecasts over time and/or space. Results are shown 
separately for the three categories, and for all the categories pooled together (top left). The reliability statistics are 
calculated using predictions for all gridpoints / stations / series. By default, the probabilistic forecasts are binned to the 
nearest 10% (in accordance with the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/wmo/lrfvs/Attachment_II-8.doc" class=link>WMO's Standardized 
Verification System for Long-Range Forecasts (SVSLRF)</a>, but 5% probability bins can be selected using 
<A HREF="Options_Verification.html">Options ~ Verification Settings</A>. Even though the forecast probabilities are binned, the 
point on the <i>x</i>-axis is shown at the average of the forecasts in the bin rather than at the centre of the bin. Similarly, 
the resolution slopes are calculated using the actual forecast probabilities (not binned), as are the Brier and ranked 
probability scores. (The Brier and ranked probability scores can be calculated using forecast probabilities at the central 
point of the bin using <A HREF="Options_Verification.html">Options ~ Verification Settings</A>.)<P>

The reliability curve is shown by the thick line, while the thin line of the same colour is a linear regression fit to the 
reliability curve weighted by the number of forecasts in each probability bin
(<A HREF="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0434(1998)013%3C0795:ACSOTU%3E2.0.CO;2">Wilks, D. S., and A. H. 
Murphy, 1998</A>). The resolution slopes are calculated from this regression line. The solid 45 degree diagonal shows the line 
of perfect reliability. The dashed diagonal is the so-called no-skill line (a reliability curve that is shallower than this 
will score a negative Brier skill score against climatology). The horizontal line represents the line of no resolution and 
crosses the <i>y</i>-axis at the observed relative frequency for all years. Note that his value is not necessarily the same as 
the climatological probability of an event since the observed relative frequency is defined only over the retroactive period in
the case of retroactive forecasting, and in the case of the double cross-validated forecasts the categories are identified 
out-of-sample.<P>

The reliability statistics can be saved by right-clicking on the graphs. In a similar manner the graphs themselves can be saved 
and the titles customised. The graphs can be saved individually or as a montage as a BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PCX, or PNG file by 
right-clicking anywhere in the child window and selecting <B>Export</B>. A default name is given to the graphic file, but this 
name can be changed using the browse button. The quality of the JPEG file can be adjusted using the slider or by the quality 
indicator, which ranges between 0.01 and 1.00. The highest quality is obtained using 1.00. The size of the JPEG file is 
affected by the quality chosen, with larger files being generated the higher the selected quality. The image quality for all 
the graphics formats can be improved by increasing the size of the image (see 
<A HREF="Options_Graphics_GrphScaling.html">Options ~ Graphics ~ Graph Scaling</A>). The graphic titles can be set using the 
<B>Customise</B> option upon right-clicking in the child window. Further options for customizing the graphs, including 
adjusting the size of the fonts, and the size of the images are available from <A HREF="Options_Graphics.html">Options ~ 
Graphics</A>.<P>
