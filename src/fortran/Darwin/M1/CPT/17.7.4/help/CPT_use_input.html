<H2>Input Datasets</H2>
Two datasets are required by CPT. The first dataset contains the "X variables". These variables are sometimes called 
"predictors", "independent variables", or "explanatory variables". In the context of MOS applications, the X variables will 
normally be a GCM output field, such as precipitation or geopotential heights, while in a more traditional model the X
variables typically will be something like a set of sea-surface temperature data, or an ENSO index. The X variables are used to 
predict the variables in the second dataset, which should contain the "Y variables". The Y variables are sometimes called 
"predictands", "dependent variables", or "response variables". Most frequently the Y dataset contains a set of station monthly
rainfall totals or temperature averages.<P>

For seasonal forecasting applications, the X input file should typically have one set of data per year. The Y input file should 
either also have one value per year, or it can contain monthly data. If the Y file contains monthly data, you may be prompted 
to indicate the season that you wish to predict. However, if the X input file is a GCM output file with cpt:S and cpt:T 
<A HREF="CPT_use_input_tags.html">tags</A>, CPT will calculate the seasonal average or total without prompting for the 
season. If you want the X and the Y dates to be the same (or to overlap), you should switch on  
<A HREF="Options_Data_Synchronous.html">Synchronous Predictors</A> first.
 
The datasets should be specified by locating the file using the "browse" buttons. After selecting, a file CPT will 
automatically try to identify the structure of the dataset and the amount of data in the file. The CPT program requires the 
input files to follow strictly one of three structures (<A HREF="CPT_use_gridded.html">gridded</A>, 
<A HREF="CPT_use_stations.html">station</A>, and <A HREF="CPT_use_indices.html">unreferenced</A> or index), each of which is 
described on the following pages. Currently, the input files for each of these structures must be in ASCII (or text) format, 
although other formats are being developed and will be implemented in later releases of the software.<P>

New input file formats were introduced in CPT version 10.01. The current version of CPT is able to read the new formats 
(described in the next few pages) and the <A HREF="CPT9_formats.html">old files</A>, but CPT versions 10+ are more flexible 
than version 10. The old formats are unable to support some of the new features of CPT, including multiple fields, and 
so-called "EOF extensions" (which are typically the inclusion of additional predictors at different lags, and which are called 
"lagged fields" in CPT). More importantly, CPT will not be able to correctly identify appropriate start dates or the length of 
the training period in some cases if the old formats are used (see further discussion of the cpt:S and cpt:T 
<A HREF="CPT_use_input_tags.html">tags</A>). In versions 11+, the CPT version 10 file formats have been simplified somewhat, 
and some increases in flexibility of both the old and the new formats have been implemented to allow improved handling and 
simpler construction of files.<P>

All version 10+ file formats must begin with the following first few lines. The first line of an input file is always:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
xmlns:cpt=http://iri.columbia.edu/CPT/v10/
</PRE>
This tag defines an <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Namespace">XML namespace</A> for the "cpt" prefix to be used in 
subsequent lines. This line should be copied exactly as it is in the top of all CPT version 10+ input files.<P>

The second line indicates the number of "fields" in the file:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
cpt:nfields=1
</PRE>
A "field" is set of variables for the same meteorological parameter measured at different locations; for example, a rainfall 
measurements at a set of stations, or a grid of sea-surface temperature records. In older versions of CPT only one field was 
permitted, but from CPT version 10 multiple fields can be used. Additional fields can represent different meteorological 
parameters, and/or different the same parameter at a different lag. Identical parameters at different lags can be represented 
as separate fields or as lagged fields. Mathematically lagged fields and fields are handled identically, and so it does not
matter how they are represented. There are some restrictions on lagged fields, but they may be easier to format, especially in 
station and unreferenced files. The following pages describe the distinctions in more detail. How the different fields are set 
out in the file depends on the file type, as described in the following sections. If nfields=1, then this line can be omitted
in CPT version 12+.<P>

For probabilistic forecast input files the next line indicates the number of categories in the file:<P>
<P>
<PRE>
cpt:ncats=3
</PRE>
Currently, the number of categories is constrained to be 3. For other input files this line should be omitted.<P>

In version 10+ file formats, the next line contained the tag cpt:T followed by a list of all the dates in the file. This 
line is no longer required, and is ignored if the line exists. CPT version 11+ does not include this line in output files.<P>

The next line contains a series of <a href="CPT_use_input_tags.html" class=link>CPT tags</a> that set information about the 
immediately following block of data. This information depends on the file structure, and so this line is described separately 
for each format. The tags can appear in any order, but some tags are compulsory and others optional. Each tag is preceded by 
"cpt:" followed by the name of the tag, then "=" and the value that the tag takes. The tags associated with the different CPT 
data formats are described in detail in the following pages and the meanings of each of the 
<a href="CPT_use_input_tags.html" class=link>tags</a> is provided if needed.<P>

It is important to consider which dates to include in the input datasets since the analyses that CPT will perform depend upon 
how the data are structured. When using CPT for seasonal forecasting, the Y file would typically contain only one set of values 
per year unless you specifically wish to forecast multiple target periods synchronously. These Y values would normally be a 
seasonal total or average. However, in version 14+, if the Y file contains monthly data and all months are present then CPT will 
either identify the appropriate season automatically, or <a href="Edit_TargetSeason.html" class=link>prompt for the season</a>, 
and then calculate the seasonal totals or averages. CPT can identify the season automatically when using the 
<a href="View_PFV.html" class=link>Probabilistic Forecast Verification (PFV)</a> option, or if the 
<a href="CPT_use_input_tags.html" class=link>cpt:S tag</a> is set in the X file.<P>

For the X file, if all twelve months are present, CPT will read the data as if there were a total of 12 lagged fields. It would 
almost certainly be inappropriate to include all 12 months in the X file. 

If CPT is being used on daily, pentadal, or dekadal data, lagged fields are not implicitly recognised, and so any desired lags 
have to be included as separate fields.<P>
